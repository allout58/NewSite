        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>NewSite is owned and operated by James Hollowell. With a BS in computer science and 2 years of web design
            experience, he is highly qualified to lead this company and work for our customers. James started
            programming at a young age, learning web coding during a summer program at a local library. Since then, he
            has been fascinated with the world of computer science, constantly striving to be better. Recently, he
            worked with some small businesses doing odd jobs on their websites, and found out just how much they could
            benefit from a professionally designed and created website.</p>
        <p>We love working with small businesses because we are one. We understand how small businesses run and some of
            the oddities that come with running a small business. We are here to help you achieve <strong>your</strong>
            goals and reach <strong>your</strong> customers.
