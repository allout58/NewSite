                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span class="tldr">We give you a custom site, made by people not computers.</span><br/>
                    <span>At NewSite, we focus on the personal touch we can give your site.</span><br>
                    <span>Each site is a custom creation, with lots of thought put into the design. Unlike most of our competition, we do the design work for you and we don't force you to use a template.</span><br />
                    <span>We are a small business, so we know what it takes to effectively run and market a small business. We are here to help you succeed!</span>

                <div class="collapsible-header">What if I have a deadline? Can you get it done by <em>&lt;insert date
                        here&gt;</em>?
                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span class="tldr">Yes!</span><br/>
                    <span>We will work with you to prioritize parts of your website and determine what parts we will be able to complete by your deadline. If we don't think we will be able to complete all the parts of your website you deem most important by your deadline, we will tell you so up front and suggest other options to help you meet your deadline.</span><br/>
                    <span>If we have to work overtime to complete your site by a given time, there will be an extra $3/hr charge.  We also can't do the impossible, and we value you, our customer, too much to work round-the-clock and risk making poor design choices that could negatively impact your site.</span>

                    <span>If we can't do it, we will let you know up front and if possible refer you to another company that can do it.</span><br>
                    <span>Also, do realize that non-standard features might take a lot of time to develop, and we charge for the design and creation of your website by time.</span>

                    <span>By using our shared server, you pay much less than normal for your hosting.  However, this means that the uptime of your website depends on the uptime of the shared server. Our current server provider has a 99.9% uptime guarantee, and as such your site will have close to 99.9% uptime, with occasional downtime for software updates. In the event of such a scheduled downtime, all our customers will be notified beforehand.</span>
