                    <span>At NewSite, we focus on the personal touch we can give your site.</span><br>
                    <span>Each site is a custom creation, with lots of thought put into the design. Unlike most of our competition, we do the design work for you and we don't force you to use a template.</span>

                        here&gt;</em>?

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span>This answer will change depending on how many other customers we have at the moment, but the answer is probably!</span><br>
                    <span>If we have to work overtime to complete your site by a given time, there will be an extra $3/hr charge.  We also can't do the impossible, and we value you, our customer, too much to work round-the-clock and risk making poor design choices that could negatively impact your site.</span>

                </div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span>Probably! Some things might not be feasible for a small development company like NewSite to do or might not be possible for websites. Also, do realize that non-standard features might take a lot of time to develop, and we charge for the design and creation of your website by time.</span>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span>Our maintenance plan covers any small tweaks, changes, or additions to the content or design of your site every month. You have a limited number of change request each month you pay for though, so be careful!</span><br>
                    <span>If we break something in the process of updating backend software or implementing one of your other changes, the fixes are on us!</span>

                <div class="collapsible-header">What guarantees can you provide for site uptime?</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <span>Unfortunately, we can provide little guarantees for uptime, as your site will be hosted on a shared server. This reduces costs and allows us to more easily update and manage your site, but increases the possibility of problems.</span><br>
                    <span>If you are very concerned about keeping your site online, we can still design your site and assist you in setting up your site with a different service.</span>
